# Dropbox

This is a custom package for Dropbox.

Currently we install the official Debian builds.

We may want to build from source in the future, but it's also likely that
[new CLI](https://github.com/dropbox/dbxcli) that is written in Go will
gain [sync feature](https://github.com/dropbox/dbxcli/issues/112).
